        <p>As was natural, this <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>inordinate hope</span></a> was followed by an excessive depression. <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books</span></a> and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>searches should cease</span></a> and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>canonical</span></a> books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-1"><span>forbidden dice cup</span></a> and feebly <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>mimic the divine disorder</span></a>.

        <p>Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-1"><span>eliminate useless works</span></a>. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books</span></a>. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal</span></a>. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-6"><span>imperfect facsimiles</span></a>: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>the Purifiers' depredations</span></a> have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>delirium</span></a> of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
